#### Who am I?
- I’m an aspiring Embedded Systems Engineer with three years of experience in the field. I have a strong passion for hardware engineering, specializing in firmware development using FPGAs and System-on-Chips to create complex boards for applications in photonics, sound, and RF technologies. I’ve designed numerous industrial-grade devices and test benches tailored to specific requirements.

#### What am I up to?
- Currently, I’m working as a Linux Security Engineer, focusing on applying security patches to server network infrastructure and hardening Linux systems and kernels. After taking a break from embedded device design and programming, I’m excited to dive back in and share some of my personal projects. My current focus is exploring the Rust programming language by migrating a couple of my project to it, to evaluate its potential compared to traditional firmware development in C, alongside some new hardware designs.
